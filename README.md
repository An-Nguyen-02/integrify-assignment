# Shopping-web

## Purpose

My purpose is to re practice designing web with react as well as a pre assignment for Integrify Academy.
This is a website calls API of countries, display them and user can search them by name. There are sorting base on countries entities. And when click on details of a page, it bring to the country's route, which user can see more details such as country's location, link to google Map, going back to home page.

## Features

- The application satisfy all basic requirements
- Buy item and payments (used Stripe)
- Use custom useFetch hook for calling API
- Uses MUI
- Visual styling is not optimized, I created components in folder so that later can add css styling in if needed.
- Optimized using fallback, suspense, lazy load, useCallback
- Use contextAPI to manage countries data 
- Test with snapshot using Jest
- Deployed on Netlify ith redirects.
